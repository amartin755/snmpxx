# SNMP++
This is an unofficial mirror of SNMP++ from https://agentpp.com/. I created this repository so that it can easily be used as a Git submodule in other projects. It contains all official releases >= V3.4.9
## Branches
### original
Contains the unchanged extracted tarballs downloaded form https://agentpp.com/download.html.
Each official release is tagged "vX.Y.Z".

### master
Maintains out-of-tree bugfixes and changes that I need for my own projects.
